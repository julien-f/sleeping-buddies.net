# sleeping-buddies.net

> Social networking website which helps to find people to share a bed with.

## Presentation

New weapon against
[loneliness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loneliness), *sleeping-buddies.net*
aims to help people to find other people to share a bed with.

Why? Because [hugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hug) are good for
humans, and being with one another can really help (take a look at the
[Free Hugs
Campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Hugs_Campaign)).

***sleeping-buddies.net* is not about sex!** You are of course free to
engage in any activities you like with the people you met (as long
as its consensual of course) but this is **not** the primary goal.

### Values

1. Respect
- Trust
- Privacy

### Concepts

- Web of trust (similar to [PGP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy#Web_of_trust))
